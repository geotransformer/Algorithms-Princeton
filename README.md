# Algorithms & Data Structures in Java
 "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs" Niklaus Wirth, 1976 
# Programming language
Programming languages are used in computer programming to implement algorithms and data structures, i.e., programs. 

The many existing languages can be classified into families based on their model of computation. 
The top-level division distinguishes between the declarative languages, in which the focus is on what the computer is to do, 
and the imperative languages, in which the focus is on how the computer should do it.

Java is an imperative language, originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in 1995.
